/**
 * Regression test suite for 채굴 공방 (gacha-factory-prototype).
 *
 * This does NOT reimplement the game — it loads the actual index.html,
 * evaluates its <script> in a jsdom window, and drives the real functions
 * and DOM (buttons, selects) exactly as a browser would. Balance-formula
 * tests compare the game's real output against independently hardcoded
 * reference values (not values re-read from BALANCE), so a regression in
 * BALANCE itself would be caught rather than silently treated as correct.
 *
 * Run: npm test   (or)   node tests/regression.test.js
